# pdf-bookmark-maker

Clojure and the PDFBox Java library to do stuff with PDF files.

## Usage

### Print bookmarks

```
pbm print ${PDF}
```

### Add bookmarks

```
pbm add ${BOOKMARK_FILE} ${PDF_FILE} ${PAGE_OFFSET (optional)}
```

Bookmark files are formatted text files. A bookmark line appears in
this format:

```
${INDENT} ${TEXT} ${PAGE}
```

The `${PAGE_OFFSET}` variable will add a bookmark to pdf file at `${PAGE +
PAGE_OFFSET}`.

If `${PAGE}` is empty then the bookmark link will default to the first
page or the same page as the parent bookmark.

`${PAGE_OFFSET}` defaults to 0.

#### Example File

```
Contents 14

1. A 20
 1.1 A1 30
 1.2 A2 31
2. B 40
 2.1 B2 43
 
Index 50
```

## make a standalone executable with lein-binplus

https://github.com/BrunoBonacci/lein-binplus

To Install lein-binplus in your ~/.lein/profiles.clj just add the dependency like:

``` clojure

{:user
 {:plugins
  [[lein-binplus "0.6.6"]]}}

```

Then inside this project's directory:

`lein bin`


### alternatively create an uberjar 

create an uberjar in the target/ folder:

`lein uberjar`

I copy the uberjar into ~/bin/ and create a shell file pbm.sh:

``` sh

java -jar pbm-uber.jar "$1" "$2" "$3"

```

`chmod +x ~/bin/pbm.sh`
