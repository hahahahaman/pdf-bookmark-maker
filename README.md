# pdf-bookmark-maker

Command line tool to create bookmarks for PDFs.

## Usage

### Print bookmarks

```
pbm print ${PDF}
```

### Add bookmarks

```
pbm add ${BOOKMARK_FILE} ${PDF_FILE} ${PAGE_OFFSET (optional)}
```

Bookmark files are formatted text files. A bookmark line appears in
this format:

```
${INDENT} ${TEXT} ${PAGE}
```

The `${PAGE_OFFSET}` variable will add a bookmark to pdf file at `${PAGE +
PAGE_OFFSET}`.

If `${PAGE}` is empty then the bookmark link will default to the first
page or the same page as the parent bookmark.

`${PAGE_OFFSET}` defaults to 0.

#### Example File

```
Contents 14

1. A 20
 1.1 A1 30
 1.2 A2 31
2. B 40
 2.1 B2 43
 
Index 50
```
